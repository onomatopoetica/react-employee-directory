## About The Project

The scope of this project was to render a table of (random) employees generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). When a user loads the page, a table of employees is rendered.

A user can:

* Sort the table by pressing the sort button to scroll through employees, or

* Filter employees by entering an employee name,

* Or, simply begin entering letters in an employee's name and result will begin to render in the table.
